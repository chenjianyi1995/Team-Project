2. Title: Damn The Ram
3. Description:
	Shooting game where you are a buffalo, and those damned rams keeps coming.
	The goal is to survive as long as possible. Over time the rams will become more beefy.
	Destroying enemy rams will grant experience points. XP can be used to upgrade abilities helping with survival.
4. Vision statement:Keeping school spirit alive, one game at a time.
5. Motivation:We are CU. SKO BUFFS
6. Risks:
	We have little experience with game making, which could hinder the overall look and feel of our project.
	Environment of game making is new to all of us.
	We are alright with python, but not gods.
	Since we all are students, time we have to meet up and converse are limited.
7. Mitigation Strategy:
	Start the project early so that we will have the time required to look up issues and learn what we don't know.
	Have preplanned meeting times to discuss and share further ideas and clarify issues. 
	Also to help fix specific issues with many minds acting as one.
